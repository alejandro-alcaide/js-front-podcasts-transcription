I am delighted and proud to introduce him as Academy Award winner. And the Oscar goes to the winner, it's a tie. And any little girl who's practicing their speech on the teller you never know. Mom, I just want an Oscar. I am Katie Rich. I'm here with Richard Lawson. Hello. With David Canfield. Hello. And joining us today is not Rebecca Ford. She remains on maternity leave, but we're so excited that filling in for Rebecca both on V.F.com and now on the podcast we have Kara Warner. Hi Kara. Hooray hello. I've been referring to myself as sub Rebecca not replacement Rebecca But if you're not little Goldman listeners, we would never dream of replacing Rebecca entirely, but we feel very lucky to have Kara joining us. Kara, I feel like listeners will get to know you just over the course of recording the show and all of your Oscar Hot Takes that we look forward to you having. I mean, you live in Los Angeles, you've been reporting on this stuff for a super, super, super long time. Would you like to introduce yourself? What's your favorite Oscar contender of the year? I know we don't play favorites but just like what's like what's what's your Oscar style this year? That is such a great question. I was trying to say John Wickfor, even though it's not an Oscar contender. Already bringing a fresh energy to little man. There you go. As a lady of the people and out of the box, things, I was really hoping I'm supporting the stunt ensemble category and its future. I am still interested in the Barbie of it all, honestly. I'm so thrilled that it's sustained a life of you know continuing to get headlines and I'm kind of pleased at the outrage from the nominations last week I'm just wondering you know where else where else this story will will take us oh god I feel like I lived 10 lives since we talked about the nominations last week I think when we were recording the Hillary Clinton tweet had just come out. Yeah, that's where we were in the cycle. It was breaking. Yeah, but I'd Kara I think you'll get your wish. I don't think we're done talking about Barbie nor will we be maybe ever but certainly at least until the Oscars happen in March and who else might come out in support of Barbie I mean where can we go from here you know there's there's an entire White House it staying quiet, suspiciously quiet for now. So before we get back to Barbie and the Oscars and everything else, we have a lot of great listener questions to discuss. We did want to check in on the Sundance Film Festival. Richard, last week you were calling in from Sundance to talk about the Oscar nominations, which always feels kind of crazy because you're like bursting to talk about all these new movies and yet you're you know talking about stuff that came out last summer but now's the chance now you can talk about what you saw and all the rest of us did get to see some Sundance titles not being in Park City but Richard we should start with you because it did seem like this year's festival, while maybe not having like a past lives, like something that we knew we'd be talking about all year, was pretty lively all the same. Yeah, there was some good stuff. I mean, it was the 40th anniversary, so there was a lot of kind of pomp and circumstance around that, and I think maybe the lineup of new film showing didn't quite live up to that kind of ceremony. But also speaking of the Oscar nominations happening during Sundance, the Oscars also now again this year are happening during South by Southwest and it's like, can we just get this? Oh, wow. Like it's just, and there's a few publicists who are like flying back and forth across the country, like over the course of a few days, it's nuts. But anyway, I think the big standout for me at the festival was a film called I saw the TV glow from Jane Shunbren who made were all going to the world's fair which premiered at digital Sundance a couple years ago. It was billed as a horror, I don't think it really is that, but Justice Smith plays a kid in the 90s who becomes obsessed with a TV show, kind of maybe Buffy-esque with some charmed and mighty-morfin power rangers thrown in there. And it gets things get darker and stranger and it's this beautiful sad metaphor for kind of identity, whether that's trans identity or queerness or, you know, sort of something in that spectrum. I think there's a lot to glean from it, depending on what you're bringing to the film. I don't know if for our purposes, it's the this huge performance from Kiran Kalkin where he's doing sort of a riff on his Roman Roy persona, sort of twiggy and anxious and caustic, but this one is sort of sadder and more of a kind of slacker type person. That was a big sale to Searchlight for $10 million and the Oscar Buzz for him. Didn't you talk to Searchlight people on the ground who were like, oh yeah, like we were all over that. Like it was a big like actual war for it. Well, before then I had spoken to some people from A24 and they were like, yeah, we took a look at that one and we went to this thing but we could already see the searchlight people surrounding them. So we kind of knew that it was not ours to win. Yeah, they were really into that and I think that that's a good home for that film. I wasn't as into it as everyone else mostly because I saw it kind of after the buzz had happened and I thought that it was a little bit slighter than I was expecting. What's a classic Sundance thing, right? Is you're like, oh, everyone's talking about this, and then the hype just high enough that a perfectly nice movie can be over-inflated for you? Exactly. I mean, I think that if it's a contender, it's really for Culkinkin I guess the question is do they run him and lead or kind of a supporting thing because it's really him and Jesse Eisenberger the co-leads of the movie they play Cousins traveling around Poland to both kind of get to know each other better as adults but also to get to know their family history, you know, particularly Jewish history in Poland, which as we know is pretty grim. So Jennifer Gray is in it, she's good. But anyway, she's so good. She's a true. Yeah. She's. I want to hear a lot from Park City, but I feel like David and I at least, I don't care, I don't think you saw this one can jump in because that was one of the titles that actually was available on the digital platform so I got to see it too and David you did as well. Yeah, we had a first look at it too before it premiered so I got to speak with Jesse Eisenberg a little bit about the film. My first impression was just like I thought it was a major step up for him from his first movie. When you are finished saving the world, there's some words in there that may not be right. It was a movie that even he had admitted to me, he felt like maybe he was in his own head a little bit too much about and the reaction to that movie was very clarifying for him as he got to making the second one. Yeah, I really responded to it. It reminded me of some international tour groups that I've been a part of and Jennifer Gray placed somebody on the tour with them, Kier and Kolkin and Jesse Eisenberg, and she really embodies a certain maternal tour companion energy that I appreciated. I thought it was really beautifully filmed and yeah I just really bought into the dynamic between these characters and I was convinced by the way in which he positions it in this larger, more tragic historical context. To me, it really worked and it felt like he did it with an impressively light touch. Yeah, and that one won what the narrative audience. So it won a prize. Screenwriting. Screen right. Yeah, I think the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award, which can be a mixed bag, honestly, in the previous years. I love Sunday's prizes can be a mixed back. Yeah, I mean, Richard, I don't know if there was anything, any other obvious like top of the heap. I feel like I saw the TV glow in a real pain have felt like very obvious standouts to me from a distance. Yeah, I think they were too with the bigger titles for sure. I mean, I saw the TV glow went into the festival already under the auspices of 824, so they didn't, they weren't for sale another big sale was to Amazon slash MGM so it'll be theatrical and streaming I guess was a movie called my old ass which I'll be curious to see if they hold on to that title. I've already gotten a lot of joke mileage out of it. How's your old ass? How's my how's my old ass? But it's really great. It's from this director writer director in Megan Parks who made a movie called The Fallout a couple years ago that I think was at Southby ended up on Max starring Jenna Ortega about a school shooting. It's a very delicate drama. I did not realize it was the same filmmaker. Yeah, it's weird that it's the same person who then made this like really fun teen comedy, but with a sad element to it I cried a lot at the toward the end of the movie but it's really great Arwe Plaza plays the older version of a teenage girl who goes on a mushroom trip and meets her older self and kind of get some warnings about life to come and is told to appreciate that stuff, you know, the her family and the stuff around her before she goes off to school because she's mostly spending her summer being a heedless teenager anyway it's really great I think that's a good home for the movie and I hope that people go see it in theaters because I think it will appeal to teens and grown-ups alike. I heard a lot of good stuff about that. I was just going to ask Richard, do you think Aubrey is playing the same version of the character she keeps playing? Question mark? I think that we see some of the U-Typical Aubrey Plaza stuff in there, but as the movie goes and you start to realize what is really at stake emotionally in the movie which I don't want to spoil it all but like then we see some variation it there's one scene that is pretty much straight dramatic that she's, Wabria Plaza is like really like incredible in very subtly. So it shows a good range I think of her. You know it's funny she's kind of becoming this like Sundance Queen, I mean between this and Emily the Criminal and she's just like a black bear, not a great movie but a really interesting performance like and then you couple that with White Lotus and stuff like she's just really one of the actors of the moment in a way that I might not have predicted you know when Parks and Rec first premiered. Carrie you did a first look feature on another sale from the festival. I don't know if it's a big blockbuster resale like a real pain but I'm excited to see the Sue Bird documentary that you wrote about now that it's on Netflix right? I so appreciate you bringing that up. Not everyone is psyched about sports documentaries. I am one of the sports fans, one of the few here. You're feeling an important niche on this podcast whereas we've had none before so I don't know if you heard it's talk about Marcia and Lynch when he got a spirit nomination but it did not bring I did we heard about that that. Yes, I was quietly giggling to myself, Marshall Lynch. What a star now on the screen and formerly on the field. But yes, so Sue Bird in the clutch, it's really, it's just a really lovely moving portrait of Sue Bird. I mean, she's one of the best basketball players ever to play the game, did incredible groundbreaking work for the WMBA, kind of on and off the court. It's a great portrait of someone that more people should know about. It was a big docks here. There's a movie about Christopher Reeve kind of post-accident, the accident that left him paralyzed and his kind of campaign to both keep living his life but also maybe get better through stem cell research it's called super slash man and it's sold to Warner Brothers for $15 million, a documentary. That's pretty significant. The reporting for Variety was that the plan might be to release it under the DC Studios label because of the Superman Connection connection which I think maybe is a little weird and cynical. They're getting rid of all of their superhero movies but they're really seeing the documentary. Yeah, documentaries, sad documentaries about horrible injuries. But that was a big deal. And then you had kind of a little bit later in the festival, this movie called Will and Harper, which is Will Farrell and his long, many decades long friend, Harper Steele, who was a writer on SNL and then collaborated with Farrell and some of his weirder movies over the years. And then a few years ago, Harper came out as a trans woman and it's a the film is about Farrell and Steele going on this road trip and discussing the transition and how life has changed and what Harper hopes to get from her life now that she's living and out life. And it's very populist. A lot of the movie feels kind of storyboarded, a lot of planned scenes. But then in between those there's just really raw like organic conversation about this and I think it really invites let's say people who are not as keyed into the discourse about trans issues, invites them into kind of listen and learn, I think, in a very not to be cynical, like, once, but like very commercial way. And I'm, it hasn't sold yet as far as I'm aware but I think it will be big and I think it will get a huge awards push because it is I dare say something could function as like an important instructive film for people who you know need to hear it I guess. I thought that movie was so lovely and the one thing you can't really plan for that was the reason I was so taken with it is seeing this relationship both redefine itself a little bit and get back to perhaps where it was in a way and the level of comfort between them developing the more they talk about these things. I thought it was at times yes it felt like a pretty staged, but it was really effective because the intimacy between them was pretty undeniable. I would love to shout out my favorite movie from the festival, which was also a documentary, less pleasant. It's called Black Box Diaries. It is a pretty brilliant and really inspiring movie in a lot of ways. It follows a journalist who essentially investigates her own sexual assaults. She was assaulted by somebody who was of a certain stature and it becomes this big deal in Japan where the film is set and it's just this unbelievable, really rigorous portrait of this woman taking these steps. It's fascinating and enraging and really just it's a stark movie that has stayed with me. It's the kind of movie that I don't think it is sold it will be a tougher sell but you know speaking of awards pushes and where the dock branch especially is gone lately it feels like a movie that could even like win because it is that good. Whereas I wonder if Will and Harper is maybe too populist for the and celebrity driven for the docks branch to give a nomination but for the American Symphony snubbing docks branch to bother with Michael J. Fox and Bonn, yeah. Exactly. Also on the Oscars track, Not a Documentary is a film called Exhibiting Forgiveness starring Andre Holland. Semi-autographical story about an artist kind of struggling with the psychic wounds left on him by his father who you know kind of reappears into his life. Angenuou Ellis Taylor plays Andre Helen's mother. Andre Day is his wife. It's a really good ensemble cast, but Andre Holland is really the star of it, and it's a really incredible performance, and I think that with the right distributor It could go places he is so good in that movie And it's like cool to see him get a lead like that. You know because like he's so good in everything, but he hasn't had that kind of centerpiece thing before. Yeah, yeah long overdue. I'm Hillary Bussis and I'm Richard Lawson and we're from Vanity Fair's still watching podcast after a nearly five-year hiatus true detective is back. I'm working on this new case a missing scientist found on the edge of the villages, frozen solid. We're following the HBO mystery as it unravels week to week. We're also going to be talking to the stars of the show and making our own predictions along the way. New episodes of still watching will drop every Sunday after True Detective Airs. I wanted to go to a listener question on the topic of distributors because I was realizing a lot of titles that this year Sundance had distributors and you know the 824 films were not available on the platform which is you know why you haven't been able to see things like this like I saw the TV glow or a different man which David you wrote about and we had a question from Camden basically asking do you think festival buzz or a good distributor matters more for films at earlier festivals? Both a thousand and one and Passlides were both big hits at the 2023 Sundance, but Passlides has gone so much further. I think it's an interesting question because Neon, A24, Focus, Apple, are bringing their movies to these festivals. And a lot of those are some of the more prominent titles I've heard about but I don't know Richard you were on the ground there do you notice that difference when you're actually there I mean I think the distributor matters a great deal in terms of resources and strategy you know I think the problem with a movie like a thousand and one is that I think it has some shakier elements to it than does pass lives but like a thousand one was also put out by focus in April in this kind of like no man's land and I think that there was anticipation for past lives it went to Berlin after it went to Sundance and then it you know there were a couple of more months and then it came out and I think May or early June so there was a more of a build for it whereas a thousand and one which won the jury prize at Sundance in its year like just kind of didn't it didn't have the runway or something like that and you see that happen once in a while so I think the distributors have to be very strategic but I think all in all 2001 ended up getting a lot of Spirit Award nominations like it's still sort of part of the awards conversation I think it's just a matter of quality honestly I mean a great movie could probably sell to a tiny distributor and never have a much life in terms of the stuff we talk about but like I think for the most part that the cream rises to the top yeah I think also, you know, release after distributor. I feel like release makes a big difference, you know, along with distributor, because I feel like sometimes there'll be something that's very buzzy out of a festival and then I forget about it and then I get pitched it six months later and forget it's just like well are people still talking about this movie or you know what happened with the release schedule like what do they want to do studios want to capitalize on the buzz but then there's you know the outliers everything everywhere all at once like with its release date and I never know, but I definitely always I'm always questioning like, oh why did they choose to release this? Like why not jump on the buzz? I don't know. I just always think that's interesting. No for sure I mean you also look at like the old platforming strategy that can sometimes work really well for a movie like the father where Anthony Hopkins kind of was the last big performance people saw that year and then he won. But also you look at the same studio how they handled a comma by your name which you know did win an Oscar but like didn't make as much of a dent in the box office people thought it would because they kind of people didn't really know when it was coming out and people had been talking about it for a year by the time they could see it because it premiered a year after or kind of opened wider a year after it premiered at Sundance. So I also think festival choice is interesting because sometimes you see a Sundance movie and you're like, why is this here? You know, like why didn't they try to get this into Cannes or even the fall festivals? I mean to that end there's a movie called The Outrun with Starring Sears Arron and I think it went to Sundance because it is for sale and it's a bigger buyers market than something than any of the later festivals. But that movie, I feel like, that would have played so well in like uncertain regard it can. But it kind of got swallowed up at Sundance, despite the fact that it's really good. It's tricky. I mean, I do think that the question of which festival is probably the bigger one here or the one that's sort of unspoken in that question because you know even if you look at this year's Oscar best picture nominees I think every major festival is represented Sundance has past lives tell you right the holdovers, Toronto has American fiction, Can has three movies, which we can talk about separately because that is its own development in the international growth of the academy, but it takes a certain quality and also a certain level of competition, whatever you want to call it, to be able to stand out anywhere. And I think Past Lives was able to do that, leverage that really successfully at Sundance last year in A24 was really smart to do that. But it's just, it's a bit of a guessing game and you don't always know what you're up against and especially at a place like Sundance where you're a year out from the Oscars. It's unlikely that more than one or two movies are going to go that kind of Oscar distance so you have to be careful with that. Right and has anything was it just everything everywhere? I could be misremembering. Has anything come out of Southby? Because everything everywhere was Southby, right? No, that was a real breakthrough for Southby. Well, Radio Player 1 won a bunch of Austrians, right? Dungeons and Dragons is the Best Picture nominee this year so in my heart absolutely it is it all it was in there for a second for something yeah that was big for Southby but they're not positioning themselves like that anyway you know I kind of worried that after everything everywhere that all of a sudden we'd start seeing like more kind of left of center oddball best picture hopeful's premiere there but which would kind of change the tenor. Wait wasn't to Leslie a Southby entry though? Not Best Picture. Oh my God it was. Is it really? Yeah, it must have been the same one as everything everywhere. You're 100% right. Well, Leslie made a bunch of pasta vazool and she catered at the festival, but. You never know is what we're saying here. It's true. I wanted to highlight one of the movies I did get to see that doesn't have distribution as far as I know, but it's called Good One. Did any of you guys see this one? Yeah I liked it. I liked it a lot too. Afterwards I said in my friend I was like you should have just told me it had Kelly Reichert vibes and I would have watched it a lot sooner. It's a debut feature by this director named India Donaldson and it's a very simple story of a teenage girl who's on a camping trip with her dad and her dad's friend. Her dad's friend is like super duper divorced and her dad has like remarried a younger woman and has a young child so she's kind of like witnessing this weird middle-aged man dynamic. So you've got James Legros, who's a character who's actually been in a bunch of Kelly Reichert movies, as her dad and Danny McCarthy has the friend, but Lily Collius, I think is how you say her name,, it's like Lily Collins but with an A instead of the N. I thought it was a typo in the program. I know, sure other people did. But she's really wonderful and it kind of reminds me of like Talia Ryder breaking out for never rarely sometimes always of years ago So you know when you think about performers to watch maybe in the two Leslie vein of people who you're gonna you know the movie might get slept on but will emerge sometime in the future. I would keep an eye out for her. I'm really glad I got to see that one. I don't know that it's that award to you, although it would be kind of fun if it was. But June Squib has her first ever lead role in a movie at the age of 94 in a movie called Thelma that premiered at Sundance that I really liked. It's a comedy about a woman who is still living independently in her 90s but gets scammed over the phone by someone pretending to be her grandson who was played by Fred Hetchinger in the film. And then she goes on this kind of like crime caper quest to track down the people who stole her money and get it back. And so the film kind of plays with a lot of action movie tropes, but it's offset by the fact that it's June Squib and Richard Roundtree doing these things is these kind of daughtering older people. But it's really sweet and it has a lot of, I think, insightful things to say about, you know, the pains of getting older, the sort of loneliness of it, but also some of the pleasures of it. And I think it's a really well-balanced film and June's quips really good in it. And that just got bought by Magnolia, so we'll see what they do with that. I don't again it's not really a wordsy but it was really sweet and it's the last thing I watched for Sunday as 2024 which was a nice note to end on. From what you wrote Richard and what you've said it seems like it seems a little bit like Academy bait in the sense that like who's the last best actress comedy not nominee I always look at Diane Keaton something's got to give that didn't seem like that's true right and I just seems like a 94 year old June Squib is just and she got nominated for a very broadly comic performance in Nebraska. This is true, so there is precedent. And apparently Squib is going to be the lead in a movie that's Carl Johanson's directing. So she's really, she's working. Yeah. yeah that really it really it's pretty cool. Yeah but it's really I remember I one of my first ever interviews for Vanity Fair was I interviewed June Squib for Nebraska and I went to like 15-15 Broadway where you know the Viacom offices are paramount offices are and I expected to kind of like very softly make my way through an interview with a kindly old lady and she was sharpest attack like has tons of career stories because she was like a show girl in New York and I think she was in like some kind of not Ziegfeld follies I don't think she's that old but like something akin to that and she was like she was such a pro in this like really fun like surprising great way and so it's really cool to see her ten years later land a big lead role like this. I just want to point out that Lily Tomlin got a Golden Globe nomination for Grandma, which I have no idea if this movie is similar in tone to that at all, but that feels like a precedent we should look toward. I remember that. Yeah I think there are probably four slots left for the Golden Globe comedy. Comedy musical actress. Start your engines. Yeah. Francis Fisher you know what to do. Oh I forgot to mention during the Sun Dance Film Festival I went to a ceremony and I was inducted into the H of PA so I now live in Belmont. Congratulations Richard. We always do you. Thank you. So we're not going to rejoin our current award season just to catch everybody up about where we are. It's the very beginning of February. The DGA Awards are on Saturday, February 10th. So that's really the next big award show we have coming up, although that one, it's not televised, right, David? It's just a fun clubby one in person. Correct, and Jed Apetow is returning his host and your mileage may vary on Jed Apetow. He's a very good host of this particular show. I've been the last few years. It should be a fun one and then the nominees lunch and will be on February 12th so that's when we'll see all the actors and everyone getting back in their full glam. So it's a little bit of a quiet period now as we, God knows, brace for around 8 and 9 of Barbie discourse or maybe talk about other stuff with the nominations, which is what we really like to do. We have a lot of good listener questions which felt like a really good way to get into that. As always you can email us, Little Gold Men at v.com. I don't know that we're going to include all of the questions we get but sometimes we have very practical advice about things. So please email us. We'd love to hear from you. So I'm just going to start and get into it from here. I'm going to start with this question from Ben, which is going to my personal favorite category this year which is best actor he says this is a question I just can't seem to figure out a good answer to why isn't Killian Murphy an obvious front-reiner like Oppenheimer is for Best Picture. It feels like he is the movie, why hasn't he been swept up in the Oppenheimer love and proving the big frontrunner? Is Nolan stealing the spotlight? Is it R. D.J. Is it too internal a performance? I know he still might win, but it feels like he should have it wrapped up with how much support the movie has. I find that a fascinating question that I don't have an answer for, and I'm wondering if one of you guys does. I think Ben kind of answered his own question and I'll quote Kyle Buchanan. I was talking about this exact thing with Kyle Buchanan from the New York Times at Sundance and he said, Christopher Nolan is the lead actor of that film. And I see his point and I think it's, you know, Killian Murphy does a great job but he kind of gets out of the way of the process surrounding the story and the other performances and it's kind of a more recessive thing than is Paul Giamotti, let's say, in the holdovers. I think that's what's happening. And yes, I think Nolan is kind of the man stealing focus from that movie. And obviously Downey Jr too. And also, I just think Killian is great, obviously. He's just not as out there like in front campaigning whereas you know Paul Giamatti I think has both of both of those actors have so much goodwill with the actors in the academy at large but I think when Paul was at the globes where he gave his first kind of big acceptance speech and I think it was so charming and warm and that just you know encourages the goodwill from voters and Killian has done that in in kind of a little bit but he's just not he's not as gregarious about it I guess is the word but which is not to diminish what that he's not worthy of the trophy I just think that he's not quite as out front as the rest of the cast or as Giamani. Yeah, might be a narrative thing too. I don't think he has as clear of a narrative on his own versus just being giving a really great performance at the center of the front runner. You know, Michelle Yo last year, and you know, one point worth qualifying here is like, we don't necessarily know that Killian's not a clear front runner. If he wins Sagin Baffa then he has been the industry's choice the whole time but those groups haven't weighed in yet. That's your prediction though you've been very firm about that. I have been and but last year you know at this point it looked like Kate Lanchette was in that same kind of position of you know she won critics choice she and Michelle Yo split the globes and then the tide started to turn when Michelleio won like spirit and sag and things like that. So that's kind of where you find out what the industry thinks. But in this case, I think the GMI just has a much stronger narrative in the same way that I don't know that Cape Lanchette had as clear of a narrative last year when it is really competitive and you have people trying to decide who to get behind that can make a difference. I think that's a great point with narrative. I always go back to the year I realized the Oscars didn't necessarily award the actual best performer was always a tough moment. We all have our version of that story. Right? Mine is when Kate Blanchett didn't win for Elizabeth and Gwyneth Paltrow won for Shakespeare in Love. I was like, what? Is this a popularity contest? So that's why I... There's a whole lot to talk about with that year though, Karen. I mean, yeah, legally, thematically, yes. But yeah, I think that's why I always sort of bring up, you said it better David, like narrative versus kind of who gives a great acceptance speech, but I do think there's those little highs and lows and cadences where kind of the warmth or the tide changes a little bit. And they sort of get entwined. Like Paul Giamatti has really risen to the occasion of playing this role of veteran character actor finally getting his moment. Like that is the guy who is so charming on stage when he's winning these things and and Killian is you know very humbly sweetly I would say not intentionally it would just like playing into the perception that many on the internet say have about him which is that he's a lovely man who prefers to stay home. Who can't relate, honestly, David? Especially on this podcast. I do relate. That said, how far does that take you in an ostrac context I guess we'll see are you calling us indoor kids I'm recording this in my literal closet I don't know what you're talking about. It's interesting with, we have four first time best actor nominees this year. Last year we had five, which was fun. Bradley Cooper is a repeat nominee, but you get the sense sometimes with someone's first nomination. It's like, oh good, they're finally in the club, they won't win, but it's fine. The nomination is the reward. And I think somehow that's happening more for Killian, than with Paul Giamatti or Jeffrey Wright or Como de Bingo to some extent but I don't think he's had the same kind of lead roles that those other three have had that would have made you think he should have been nominated here before. I think I I mean, Jeffrey Wright hasn't won precursors in the same way, but I feel like it seems like with him and Giamatti both, there's like, okay, come on, like it's finally time. Whereas for Murphy, it feels like maybe this is leading toward more in the future. Yeah, I think that's completely right. Yeah, I think it's still win. Yeah, Killian Murphy like has led movies before obviously, but like this is a huge studio, American Studio movie and you know this was the first time he's done, let a movie like that I think and he kind of proved he could do it, he could hold the center, the movie made a ton of money, and yeah he'll get like big prestige work after this I think. Or maybe just get to go home, whatever he was. While we're on the topic of Geomody in the Holdovers, this is not a question but a fun fact that I wanted to share. This year's from Henry, this year's nomination for the Holdovers, it's the first Christmas movie since 1947's Miracle on 34th Street to be nominated for Best Picture and before that it was 1946 as it's a wonderful life. Although if Carol had gotten a Best Picture nomination it would have counted. I just thought I should let everybody know that. I have thoughts on Little Women 2019 but... Doesn't it span a lot more than just Christmas? It does. It does. Interesting. That's a good counter. I watch it every Christmas. Did Christmas with the cranks not only win BAFT us? We'll have to look that up. Jamie Leak Hurtis famously won the Baffa, lost the Oscar, which led to the everything everyone push. Okay, let's move on from Best Actor to Best Actress. We have two Best Actress questions and bless our listeners for being as invested in this as we are. We're going to start with from Aaron. He says you frequently reference Lily Gladstone's screen time as being a potential issue with her best actress campaign, but considering past winners like Nicole Kimman in the hours, Francis McDormand in Fargo, Louise Fletcher in Cuckoo's Nest, even Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, is this really an issue? Or is it more about the impact of the role in the story, which I don't think anyone can deny for Gladstone's role in killers? You know, I think we all said that she should have gone in supporting and when she switched to lead we were nervous and it seems to have worked out really well, but I do think we talked last week about how it might start to swing backwards and I wonder if the focus on the impact in the story more than the screen time is the move to kind of get around something like that or maybe none of this actually matters. What do you guys think? That's a great question first of all not to not to kiss up to the listener questions already in my first ever podcast but honestly these are I mean anytime you guys do an all reader question I just have to say they're really astute. They're really incredible, absolutely. I think some of the performances that were listed in that group hinted the difference, which is to say Anthony Hopkins or Louis Fletcher are giving huge performances that overwhelm the movie in a lot of ways and they are more than their screen time which is to say they kind of you know expand beyond the amount of time that you see them say. With Lily Gladstone it's often a silent performance and she's brilliant in the movie but I think it's a different effect on the viewer and I just I think that the reason that I go back to it is number one that it is not like most of those other examples I suppose like a Francis McDormand is a totally fair comparison. And then it's just the matter of who she's up against in this particular year. This was a really strong year for lead actress contenders and Emma Stone is every bit of poor things and Sandra Hooler is every bit of anatomy of a fall and Annette Benning is every bit of Nia. Don't deny Annette. Forget a net. Well, but even in that one, I mean, that really is, there's, I think Annette Benning is very much benefited rightly from her chemistry of Jody Foster in that movie and they really feel like a dual nomination. Same for Carrie Mulligan, you could say for Maestro. Yes, yes, exactly. Whereas I think that those two, Emma and Sandra, are really the face of their movies, they control their movies. And so I do wonder when you have that level of screen time, and when you just have a year in which most of the nominees are from Best Picture contenders, because that didn't use to be a thing in this category at all, which is something we've talked about. I think it makes a difference, and I do think it makes it stand out a little bit more, that she's not the true lead of that movie, even if she is one of the principal characters. I would just comment really quickly is that I came to Killers really late. I kind of came to this whole set of awards season movies really late and you know where you all were participating kind of in curating the best ofs of the year and like have been with a lot of these movies longer than I have all of that preamble to say that I thought the hype might have been more like overtaking Lily's actual performance and so I finally saw the movie and was very excited that like her performance is terrific and I feel like very much a best actress like leading performance I was definitely way more I was surprised because I just thought Leonardo DiCaprio had kind of positioned himself to campaign for her and so I just thought okay what is what's all the hype doing for this movie and so when I actually saw it I was actually really very impressed with with what she does in that yeah and I bet there's plenty of Academy voters who haven't seen the movie yet. Now is there time to catch up on it and may have the exact same reaction. Hi, I'm Lale Arakoglu, host of women who travel. Each story from our guests and listeners is totally unique and utterly personal. We love hearing about your first impressions when visiting someplace new. My first trip to the Patagonia region was on the Argentine side. I couldn't believe the expansive territory. It's like being in Tibet, the emptiness and the harshness really I found transformative. Or a story told when safely back on dry land. You know things happened every single day I ran out of gas on a jet ski in the middle of the ocean and I was like what if a sea creature comes to eat me? But then I'm delusional. I was like, I'll make friends with it and it won't eat me and maybe I'll ride that back to shore. That's how it works. Join me, Valle Aarachoblu, every week for more adventures on women who travel, wherever you listen to your podcasts. Our next listener question is back to Lily Gladstone also and back into the Best Actress race and it's a real alternate universe scenario which I think we like to indulge. Basically if Gladstone had guns from Ashley, sorry I keep not doing that, Lister a question from Ashley, if Gladstone had gone supporting, do you think she would be the runaway front runner or does supporting become a horse race between her and Dave Vanjoy Randolph? And then also second part of that question how do you think the lead actress race changes without Gladstone in it? I want to do the first one first. I love that idea of a scenario. I do think Lily Gladstone would probably be running away with supporting actress somehow. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. Which is to take nothing away from Dave Van D during Randolph. No, no, it's just like, well, although the campaigning would have changed, I mean, like, because Devine is such a front runner right now that I feel like that campaign is sort of relaxed a bit. Maybe'm wrong but just from my perception I don't know what's happening in LA but but yeah I think that Gladstone for a variety of reasons her her performance has sort of a more social impact, I guess you could say, and in that regard, I think it would have been the top choice. And I think Emma Stone would have won best actors. It's an interesting question. I'm not so sure. I remember when I first saw the holdovers I came out of it and tell you right and I said I think that she can win and everyone called me crazy because at the time we assumed that it was the lead gladstone. You have to rub that in people's faces as much as you can. I will. I was right. Well, we don't know if I was right. Also about Nia David. You know, we're gonna have that conversation. I feel bad that Rebecca is not here, but yeah. However, I will say that, you however, I will say that you know, I you know, this I can't go down an eye attention right now, but I will say I was I was convinced by the internet to not believe in my own convictions and how dare I do that. But anyway, that's quite a tangent. I think that with best actors, someone recently pointed out to me a strategist who follows this stuff closely said I don't think best actresses decided at all and that the shape of the race is actually a little bit more cluttered than people think because Lily Gladstone was not nominated at BAFTA which indicates she was not in the top three vote getters there. Killers underperformed slightly with the Oscars as well as we've talked about. And then Emma Stone, of course, wins critics choice. But we don't, I don't think we have a great sense of what the industry has dubbed the frontrunner for this race. And I honestly could see almost everyone in this category, except maybe Carrie Mulligan, having a moment. could see Sandra Hooler winning Baffa. I could definitely see Annette Benning winning sag Jessica Chastain style. I mean it does feel like there's a lot of room to play here, which is really exciting. I think that adds further to the listener's question here, which is to say, it is very hard to know where Lily Gladstone is among a very crowded and kind of unique category. Well that brings us to the second part of the question about how Le Adreswood have changed. She presented a couple of scenarios and one of them is more people coalescing around Annette Benning earlier given her status as a long overdue veteran. So David not to just make keep making you talk about Naiad. Do you think that if Lily Gladstone had gone supporting that Annette Benning would not have been such a surprise Best Actress nominee last week? Well, I mean, kind of by default, no, because you'd have to your top four. You'd have your top four here and if it were Margarabi. I suppose maybe people would still consider a net bending a surprise in that scenario. That's true, but based on the numbers, she would not have been. I don't know. I agree with Richard, if I were to say who would win with Lily Glaitstern out of the equation, it would probably be Emma Stone. I think that the Annette Benning campaign has been challenged in a number of ways, particularly by the strike, and then she had a very limited time of promotion when it ended before she had to finish filming a show that's coming out later the spring and so that narrative just was always kind of up in the air. And then when the show finished filming right before voting, she came out, she did a bunch of events. I moderated one of them. Jody Foster did a belated telluride tribute because that was supposed to be a big kickoff for her was getting a telluride medallion and clearly that last rush worked in her favor and reminded people of her stature, her positioning in the race. The last thing I'll say is something I've said before. She was really the only veteran contending in this category and that can make a big difference and that I don't know that that would change that much with her with Lily in or out though that I don't know that that would change the equation much. I'm just I am on the Naiad train with David. I've loved it since I saw it. I'm I also I did a Q&A I did two Q&As with Annette and then the real Diana and Bonnie and the response to them and I think strongly for Annette in those rooms so it's's like a SAG audience and an Amppus audience, they're just really, they are so into her, which they should be. I mean, she's incredible. So I love that the campaign is still going strong and then we can still talk about her. This is a very pro nia podcast, Carrie. You are in a friendly crowd, I promise. I also think that like Killers of the Flower Moon is yes based on a true story Lily Glonstone is playing a real person but Nyad is a capital B bio pick in the very traditional Oscar sense and they love those. So, yeah, how far are these voters from that really when Jessica Chastain won just two years ago for a very down the middle biop. As usual, we have not gotten to all of our great listener questions. We're really going to keep them coming over the next couple of weeks, I think. But I feel like this is a good one to close it out on, and this comes from Haley. This year Sandra Huler is the star of two films nominated for Best Picture. That would be anatomy of a fall and zone of interest of course. When was the last time an actor was the lead or even was just in multiple best picture nominees in the same year? And I think we've already got some good answers for this. And then maybe we can come up with some more. Richard, you go. It happens more often than you would think. Tom Hardy had the Revenant and Mad Max Fury Road in the same year. Who else did we? We kind of emailed about this. There were some other folks recently. East Ray this year is an American fiction and Barbie which is very exciting Laura Dern had marriage story and little women yep 2019 that was a big year because that also was the year of Scarlet Johan for Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story. Right. Oh right. And Al Pacino in the Irishman and once upon a time in Hollywood which David I'm stealing that from you but you pointed that out. I forgot all about him being a once upon a time in Hollywood too. Plus ESA is in Spiderverse, right? Right, which is not best picture but yeah that's the enemy. She had a good year, we keep talking about that. Why do you think that it is common in this way, and not like for people who are like having a breakout year, like Alpachino had been around a million years is it just a random luck kind of thing? Yeah scheduling I guess. Sometimes these things happen in bunches like Pacino had not been talked about in that way for a really long time and he had a big year. That was the year Laura Dern won an Oscar and had a real moment. You know, it's a different explanation every time, I guess. Esa Ray kind of off of insecure, pretty in demand. I think that's how you explain that. She probably just didn't have time to be in that many movies, at least big movies before. So usually it can be not more random than you'd think but reflect an actor just kind of finally getting back or getting into a conversation that they weren't in either for a while or ever before. I've got two more that I think prove exactly what you just said. Jean-Mone in Moonlight and Hidden Figures in 2016, that was fun. And then the year after that, Timothy Shalame, and Call Me by your name and Lady Bird. I mean, that was a true like, he's here, like he is a star. I know, I mean, it really worked out great for him. Janelle too, I mean that was her those were her debuts I believe. Yeah. Was Jude Law into Best Picture nominees in 2004 or did he just get accused of being in everything in 2004? Oh God right yeah. I think at Richard's assessment is right though that so often it's like you don't know when these movies are going to come out and then they come out on top of each other. I feel like Jessica Chestain even had joked about that that people were tired of seeing her because all the sudden. Oh, Jessica Chasting, Tree of Life and the Help. Yeah. Of course. She's, she's, that's a very Timothy Shalomage nominee, Yolmaine year that she had. And Brad Pitt had Tree of Life and Moneyball. Right ball that same year. Yeah, those two were really running all over the place and that not especially great Oscar year of 2011. I still think the most impressive double up feat is Stephen Sauter getting nominated for best director for two different movies. That were there were also best picture nominees. And winning and not splitting his own phone, which is like honestly I would love an oral history of the strategist who made that possible I re-wrenched Aaron Brockovich the other night what a good movie oh my god that is a good movie wait not to circle back to where we started. Richard, did you see his movie at Sundance? I did, yeah. I love his little genre experiments. This one didn't quite work for me on a script level, but the filmmaking technique, because it's from the visual perspective of a ghost, wandering this house. I love that. It's really, it's a cousin of the David Lowry film, a ghost story in a way, but this one has much more of a distinct plot and I kind of think it never gets the engine fully going on that unfortunately, but it's also really cool because Lucy Lou is one of the leads and it's really fun to see her as the lead in like a cool indie Soderberg Sundia's movie. Do you consider his Magic Mike movies their own genre? Yeah, that's his franchise. I mean, other than oceans, you know, he has. He's got two. But I'm thinking more in the vein of Kimmy and Side Effects and Haywire, you know, when he does an action or a thriller or horror. Pulpy thriller kind of things that feel more fun because he made them. Yeah, and he's so, I just love that he's still experimenting this long into his career yeah Kimmy got the is Kimmy the best pandemic movie like oh yeah hands down so good yeah unless you count asteroid city I guess that's a different conversation. Yeah, sure. Well now that we're really off topic, we can say that's it for this week's little gold men. We'll be back next week, as I keep saying we'd love more of your questions. I think this is a good time to dive deep into some below the line categories.
